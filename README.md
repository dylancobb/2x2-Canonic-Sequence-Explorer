This is an embedded JavaScript version of my 2x2 canonic sequence generator, intended to provide GUI controls for searching and filtering patterns, and displaying information about them.
# TODO
- add root sequence filtering
- add voice pair applicability filtering
- tidy up the page visually
# Potentially in the future
- integrate VexFlow for dynamic on-the-fly notation via JavaScript
- package into a native app with something like Tauri
