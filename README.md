# Introduction
This is an embedded JavaScript version of my 2x2 canonic sequence generator, intended to provide GUI controls for searching and filtering patterns, and displaying information about them.
# Immediate TODO
- add a help menu that explains how to use the tool
- mobile-friendly interface
- tooltips
# Planned features
- add information about intrinsic potential for doubling at imperfect consonances
- text search
- better audio playback
- develop the notation rendering system more
- dynamic pattern elaboration tools when the renderer is sophisticated enough
- facility to test compatibility with another pattern with a different head but shared root sequence for double-canonic deployment, and generate the derivative requirements
- MIDI / musicXML / LilyPond exporting
- package into a native app with something like Tauri
- dark mode ðŸ˜Ž
